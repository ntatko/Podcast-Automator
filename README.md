# Podcast-Automator

This is a simple piece of code that uses a teensy 4.0 board to help my (mostly) blind use and operate a podcast recorder. I'm using Reaper64 to record his audio. Just put this on your teensy board, and it should work like a charm. Or, if you want, hook up some buttons, and be able to control your computer using big, visible arcade buttons.
